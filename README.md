## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:  

- Connecting frontend (React) with backend (Node.js/Express) via REST APIs  
- Using Axios for API calls  
- Understanding & implementing JWT tokens for secure authentication  
- Managing cookies and sessions in React  
- Protecting routes and handling unauthenticated access  
- Sending transactional emails with Nodemailer (verification & password reset)  
- Using MongoDB Atlas for cloud database management  
- Environment variables (.env) for private keys & secrets  
- Hosting frontend (Vercel) and backend Railway for free deployment

## Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world authentication system where:  

- Users must register → verify their email → then log in  
- Passwords are securely validated and can be reset via email  
- Authentication is managed via JWT tokens stored in cookies  
- Backend protects routes and ensures only verified users can log in

## Learning Goal

This was built as part of my full-stack learning journey to understand how authentication works across frontend and backend in modern applications.
